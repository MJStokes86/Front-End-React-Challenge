# Front-End-React-Challenge
This is the front end react challenge for a job I'm applying for. I have created a multi page react site convenient to navigage between two pages. 

# Step 1
yarn install

# Step 2
yarn start


Once the site is up and running, the homepage will show up. In order to view the contact page, just click the contact link from the navbar and it will take you to the page.
